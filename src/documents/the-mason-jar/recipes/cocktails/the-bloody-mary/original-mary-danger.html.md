* 2 oz Worchestershire sauce
* 6 oz freshly squeezed lime juice
* Dash or two of pickle juice.

The Original Mary Danger
-----------

* Edge a large class with [salt]().
* Pour in a shot or two of [Morgana spice and herb vodka](). Strain if needed.
* Pour in the mix, fill about 2/3rds of the glass.
* Add ice. Be sure and leave some room in the glass.
* If you have it, pour a little Guinness on top.
* Add garnishes. Here is where you get creative.
 * Pickled beans
 * Cucumber rolled in a bit of [salt]().
 * Pickled asparagus
 * Celery
 * Skewer of cocktail onions and/or olives.
 * Fresh grated tumiric
 * Sprinkle of smoked peprika
 * Some ground pepper.


Notes
-----------

* Go easy on both celery and pepper as they can overwhelm the taste a bit.
* For a vegan version, use tamari, soy or a bit of Bragg's liquid amino mixed with tamarind paste instead of Worcestershire.
* Substitute [Esmerelda pepper vodka]() if you want heat, or [Ursula cucumber vodka]() if you want something more crisp.
