The Mason Jar
===========

Home-crafted, open-source cocktails & accoutrements.

The Mason Jar is open source. Feel free to fork this repo and do with the recpies what you will. Having said that, our goal is to collect some amazing recpies. We welcome pull requests, especially for new recipes! For existing recipeis, be sure and let us know why you think your version is an improvement and we'll try it out.  Of course credit will be given and maintained for everything.

Every recipe we add to this repo will also be added to our website at [the-mason-jar.com](http://www.the-mason-jar.com).

More to come!
