# The Mason Jar Project - www - powered by [DocPad](http://docpad.org)

A static front-end to the primary repo.  Still a lot of work to be done here.

To build the site:

1. Commit any changes to the primary repo and push them up to Github.
2. Run git submodule update to pull them down.
3. Go into the submodule directory and commit the new changes.
4. Run docpad build.
5. Commit this repo.
4. Push all of the things.
